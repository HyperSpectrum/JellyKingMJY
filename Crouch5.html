        <h3><p>You charge forward gaining speed and go down to the floor and go for a quick jab.
            Catching the prince off guard, you've gained the upper hand and used the most of it thrusting your sabre at the prince.
            The prince quickly parries, but with a "clink".
            The prince fails to ward off the attack resulting in your sabre digging deep into his flesh.
            Losing strength onto his grip, his sabre falls out of his hand.</p></h3>
