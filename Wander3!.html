            Going around enjoying your time you finally realize that you don't know where you are.
            You hear some movement around you and see a glimpse of a silvery shine.
            Then the next thing you know is that you're falling down and feel a bit sleepy.
            Slowly losing consciousness, the last thing you see is the smile of the perpetrator standing above you with a silvery shine in its grip.
            Then the next thing you know is that everything went dark.</p>
