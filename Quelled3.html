        <p>With that out of the way you wonder what your first royal decree would be, but before you ponder for long.
            The door to your throne room suddenly bursts open revealing a squid with a royal demeanor with some soldiers.

            "I do not acknowledge your rule and shall now take what's rightfully mine!"
            How do you respond?

        <a href="Duel4.html">It seems I need to prove to you that I'm not some weakling! I challenge you to a duel!</a>
