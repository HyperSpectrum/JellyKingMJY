        <h3><p>You charge foward planning to finish this quickly to swiftly gain the upper hand, but the prince wasn't lying when he said that he was no amateur in swordplay!
            He parried your sabre and shoved you with his body. You stutter,losing your stance and leaving you completely open.
            The prince takes this opportunity perfectly and goes for a quick jab straight for you vitals.
            You look down to see a foriegn object in you "Hah, it seems like you were too overconfident in your skills" says the prince while pulling his sabre back.
            You stumble backwards and fall on the floor, the look of the ceiling was your final sight.</p></h3>
